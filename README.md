# Drone Path Planning with APF and Impedance Control

This repository contains a Python implementation of a drone path planning algorithm using Artificial Potential Fields (APF) and Impedance Control. The main components of the project include:

- `APF.py`: Contains classes and methods for the Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm (APF Parameters).
- `Impedance_Drones.py`: Implements impedance controllers for drones and obstacles (Impedance Control Parameters).
- `run.py`: Executes the main algorithm with specified parameters.
- access directory `apf_only` to see results without impedance controller - individual apf on each drone

## How to Run

To execute the algorithm, run the `run.py`. Change the obstacle positions, radius of obstacles, number of drones, etc in this file.

The codes are not final version and are in progress for improvement.
